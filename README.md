- Hey, it's me, Misaki.
- I don't have much time to explain everything, I just want you to know that... God, it's embarrassing...

- I'm in love with you.
- Ugh, I know it might be so fast, sure, we don't even know each other, but... I already know enough about you to like you.
- I know you have other girls after you, yes, but... I'd like us to be more than just "childhood friends."

What do you say? Would you like to be my girlfriend?

- Misaki
